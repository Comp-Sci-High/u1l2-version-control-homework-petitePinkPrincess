let versionControlExplanation = "it helps us to track changes and add checkpoint so we can come back to it without losing the future code";

console.log("What is version control?");
console.log(versionControlExplanation); 

// In the terminal, run "node index.js" to run and test your code.

/* 
   At this point, commit your work with an appropriate commit message.
   After committing, proceed to the next questions.

console.log(gitRepoExplanation); 

// 3. Name the benefits of using version control.
// Write your answer as an array of strings below, with each string being a benefit.
let versionControlBenefits = ["tracking changes", "can be reverted back to old code", "easier collaboration"];

console.log("What are the benefits of using version control?");
console.log(versionControlBenefits); 

/* 
   At this point, commit your work with an appropriate commit message.
   After committing, proceed to the final question.
*/

// 4. Explain the steps to pushing changes in Git.
// Write your answer as an array of steps below, with each step being a string.
let stepsToPushChanges = ["stage the change using git add (save the changes you want to save", "commit the changes using git commit -m (create checkpoint to the changes in your local repo, no one can see it yet)", "push your changes using git push (make your changes public to the remote repo)"];

console.log("What are the steps to pushing changes in Git?");
console.log(stepsToPushChanges);
